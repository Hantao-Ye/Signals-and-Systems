## signals

### communication system

a function conveys information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon

### physical world

quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space

**signals are mathematical functions**

- Independent variable = time

- Dependent variable = voltage, flow rate, sound pressure, ...

**signals can be represented by graph**

## classifications of signals

### continuous-time and discrete-time signals

- continuous-time signals' independent variable is continuous:
  $$x(t) = e^t$$
- discrete-time signals are defined only at discrete times:
  $$x[n] = 2^n$$

- the independent variable is inherently discrete

- sampling of continuous-time signals

### analog and digital signals

- analog signals: continuous in both time and amplitude
- digital signals: discrete in both time and amplitude
